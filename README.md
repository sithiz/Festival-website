# Festival-website
## Capstone Project


#### The goal of this project will be to take a website from start to finish using skills and tools learned from the Immursive. I will create a festival to take place sometime in the upcomming summer season. It will be fully functioning site like any other you will visit. It will use react as its main front end, and a SQL database to log all people who 'bought' tickets. The main page will be a SPA style and users can navage through it via buttons at the top. It will store basic information for your ticket which the user will have to supply. Ultimatly I wanted to create something a bit more fun for the final project that also incorperated many of the tools learned.
