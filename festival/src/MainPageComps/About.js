			<h1>Festival Namee</h1>
				<p> Imagine a Dancefestopia where there isn’t a separation of Forest and Field camping. We are all one, together in the manicured Forest – glowing magically under the twinkling trail lights. </p>
				<p> Imagine DFT nestled in rolling hills surrounded by thousands of acres of forest and pristine lake water – bound together tightly with the incredible vibes you’ve come to Love about Dancefest.  </p>
				<p> Imagine an Emerald City that is built with the conveniences of running water, electricity, camping cabins, a swimming pool, and stunning views. </p>
				<p> Dancefestopians… we have an amazing home. </p>
